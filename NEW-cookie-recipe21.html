      <h1>The Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie</h1>
      </div>

    <div><hr class="hr1"></div>

    <div class="intro">
    <p>This is essentially a hack of the most famous cookie recipe in the world, which we
      all know from the back of the Nestle “morsel” bag. Extra chewiness is attained by
      substituting bread flour for regular all purpose, replacing one egg white with milk,
      and changing the ratio of brown to white sugar.</p>

      <h3>*I don’t recommend half or double batches. Instead, make a whole batch, bake what
        you want, portion and freeze the rest.</h3>

        <p><strong>Another note:</strong> Keep in mind this is a “chocolate chip” cookie and therefore the quality
          of the final product will be greatly effected by the quality of the chips used.
     Although the semi-sweet “morsels” that we all know from the yellow bag are serviceable,
     I’d suggest combining such kid-friendly fodder with something a bit more daring,
     say dark chocolate chips/chunks in the 68% cocoa range. Oh, and remember you can chop your own.</p>

     <p> <strong>Total time: 1 hr 50 min</strong> // Prep: 20 min // Inactive: 1 hr // Cook: 30 min </p>

    <h3>*Cook’s Note The darker the sugar you use, the chewier your cookies will be.</h3>

  <div class="Ingredients">
    <ul><h2>Ingredients:</h2></ul>
    <li>16 Tbsp. (2 sticks)</li>
    <li>unsalted butter 12 oz.</li>
    <li>(2 1/2 cups) bread flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
    <li>2 oz. (4 1/2 Tbsp.) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>8 oz. (1 cup) light brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
    <li>1 oz. (2 Tbsp.) whole milk</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
    <li>12 oz. chocolate chips</li>
  </div>

<div class="Direction">
  <ol><h2>Directions:</h2></ol>
  <li>Melt the butter in a 2-quart saucepan over low heat, then set aside to cool slightly.</li>

  <li>Sift together the flour, salt and baking soda onto a paper plate.</li>

  <li>Pour the butter into your stand mixer’s work bowl. Add the sugars and beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed for 2 minutes.</li>

  <li>Meanwhile in a separate bowl, whisk together the whole egg, egg yolk, milk and vanilla extract.</li>

  <li>Slow the mixer to “stir” and slowly work the egg mixture into the butter and sugar. Mix until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds</li>

  <li>Using the paper plate as a slide, gradually integrate the dry ingredients, stopping --
  a couple of times to scrape down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula</li>

  <li>Once the flour is worked in, drop the speed to “stir” and add the chocolate chips.</li>

  <li>Chill the dough for 1 hour.</li>

  <li>Heat the oven to 375 degrees F and place the racks in the top third and bottom third of the oven.</li>

  <li>Scoop the dough into 1 1/2-ounce portions onto parchment paper-line half sheet pans, 6 cookies per sheet.</li>

  <li>Bake two sheets at a time for 15 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through.</li>

  <li>Remove from the oven, slide the parchment with the cookies onto a cooling rack, and
  wait at least 5 minutes before devouring. Makes approximately 2 dozen cookies</li>
